# FizzBuzz

[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) is a beautiful language. Among its strength
is its powerful pattern matching system which allows one to write very
declarative, elegant code. [FizzBuzz](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest) is a
trivial problem often presented to new programmers or interviewees to determine
baseline programming ability. In this repository you can see a simple solution using Elixir.
